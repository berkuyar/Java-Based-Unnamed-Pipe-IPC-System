# Java-Based-Unnamed-Pipe-IPC-System
A Java-based simulation of interprocess communication (IPC) using unnamed pipes. This project models how producer and consumer processes interact with a shared pipe under constraints such as limited buffer capacity, blocking when the pipe is full or empty, and waking up when space or data becomes available.
